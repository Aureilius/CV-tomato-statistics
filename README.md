Tomato Weight Estimation using Computer Vision
Project Overview
This project uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to estimate the weight of tomatoes from images. The system analyzes visual characteristics of tomatoes to provide accurate weight predictions without physical contact.

Features
Image Processing: Automated preprocessing and feature extraction from tomato images

Weight Prediction: Machine learning model for accurate weight estimation

Multiple Tomato Support: Can handle images containing multiple tomatoes

Visualization Tools: Tools to display results and analysis

Batch Processing: Support for processing multiple images at once



How to run the web application:
1. Install all libraries and modules
2. Install ffmpeg from Github
3. Try to run Streamlit
4. If it works properly, then drop the video
   And Finally you get your results!

Issues:
1. Needs better dataset
2. Needs good PC to run this fast
